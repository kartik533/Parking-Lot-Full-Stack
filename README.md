# Parking-Lot-Full-Stack
Parking lot created as Web App using Spring Framework for back end &amp; ReactJS for the front end. The application makes use of REST APIs to communicate back &amp; forth. Similiar to the Java app (check my ParkingLot Repo) users have access to small, medium &amp; large parking slots and upgrade to larger slots if the smalller ones are full.

-- Create a simple React & copy all the react components in the src folder of the React app.
-- I have created a maven project for spring boot part. You can create your own package structure and copy the files into the packages.
